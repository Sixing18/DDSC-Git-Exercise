# Wolvering
Wolverine is an American superhero from Marvel Comics. Wolverine, formerly known as James Howlett, is now commonly known as Law. He belongs to one of the mutants. His mutant powers have been revealed since he discovered as a child that his biological father had killed his adoptive father. He has animal senses, enhanced physical abilities, retractable bone claws and rapid regenerative and self-healing abilities, and therefore a much longer life expectancy than normal. He was later captured by William Stryker and implemented the Weapon X program, his bones were injected with Edelman alloy, and the bone claws on his hands were replaced by indestructible steel claws. This makes Logan officially become Wolverine, after he joined the X-Men and the Avengers and other superhero teams.
